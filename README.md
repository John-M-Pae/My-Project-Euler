# Project Euler
My solutions and thoughts on the various challenges of Project Euler.

## Purpose
I began this project as an exercise in two problem solving skills. The first of these is the design and execution of computational solutions to problems, the second focus is on building and maintaning a project with a well-built internal structure. I want to not only build a project which is functional, but includes testing and documentation within its structure.

## Credit to the Project Euler community
I will do everything in my ability to adhere to the guidelines given on the Project Euler [about page](https://projecteuler.net/about). This means that part of the fundamental goals of the project are to never directly post solutions to any of the problems. Additionally I will not publically post any material relating to anything beyond the first 100 problems. Any work I do with regards to these problems will be isolated and kept private.

## Timeline
I have no set timeline for this project.
